Virus Name:  PURE
Aliases:
V Status:    New, Research Viron
Discovery:   February, 1994
Symptoms:    None - Pure Stealth
Origin:      USA
Eff Length:  441 Bytes
Type Code:   OReE - Extended HMA Memory Resident Overwriting .EXE Infector
Detection Method:  None
Removal Instructions:  See Below

General Comments:

	The PURE virus is a HMA memory resident overwriting direct action
	infector. The virus is a pure 100% stealth virus with no detectable
	symptoms.  No file length increase; overwritten .EXE files execute
	properly; no interrupts are directly hooked; no change in file date or
	time; no change in available memory; INT 12 is not moved; no cross
	linked files from CHKDSK; when resident the virus cleans programs on
	the fly; works with all 80?86 processors; VSAFE.COM does not detect
	any changes; Thunder Byte's Heuristic virus detection does not detect
	the virus; Windows 3.1's built in warning about a possible virus does
	not detect PURE.

	The PURE virus will only load if DOS=HIGH in the CONFIG.SYS file.  The
	first time an infected .EXE file is executed, the virus goes memory
	resident in the HMA (High Memory Area).  The hooking of INT 13 is
	accomplished using a tunnelling technique, so memory mapping utilities
	will not map it to the virus in memory.  It then reloads the infected
	.EXE file, cleans it on the fly, then executes it.  After the program
	has been executed, PURE will attempt to infect 15 .EXE files in the
	current directory.

	If the PURE virus is unable to install in the HMA or clean the infected
	.EXE on the fly, the virus will reopen the infected .EXE file for
	read-only; modify the system file table for write; remove itself, and
	then write the cleaned code back to the .EXE file.  It then reloads
	the clean .EXE file and executes it.  The virus can not clean itself
	on the fly if the disk is compressed with DBLSPACE or STACKER, so it
	will clean the infected .EXE file and write it back.  It will also
	clean itself on an 8086 or 8088 processor.

	It will infect an .EXE if it is executed, opened for any reason or
	even copied.  When an uninfected .EXE is copied, both the source and
	destination .EXE file are infected.

	The PURE virus overwrites the .EXE header if it meets certain criteria.
	The .EXE file must be less than 62K.  The file does not have an
	extended .EXE header.  The file is not SETVER.EXE.  The .EXE header
	must be all zeros from offset 71 to offset 512; this is where the PURE
	virus writes it code.  The PURE virus then changes the .EXE header to
	a .COM file.  Files that are READONLY can also be infected.

	To remove the virus from your system, change DOS=HIGH to DOS=LOW in
	your CONFIG.SYS file.  Reboot the system.  Then run each .EXE file
	less than 62k.  The virus will remove itself from each .EXE program
	when it is executed.  Or, leave DOS=HIGH in you CONFIG.SYS; execute
	an infected .EXE file, then use a tape backup unit to copy all your
	files.  The files on the tape have had the virus removed from them.
	Change DOS=HIGH to DOS=LOW in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Reboot the
	system.  Restore from tape all the files back to your system.
