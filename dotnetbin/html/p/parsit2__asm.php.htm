;  Close to one year I created this Virus. As you can see it is quite    
;  old... Maybe too Old... But here it is... It Sucks... but its great   
;  for any virus beginner... Anyhow...                                   
;  NOTES: Simple COM infector. 10% of the time it reboots the system     
;         20% it plays machine gun noices on the PC speaker... and       
;         70% of the time is infects another COM file... Have fun...

;  Close to one year I created this Virus. As you can see it is quite    
;  old... Maybe too Old... But here it is... It Sucks... but its great   
;  for any virus beginner... Anyhow...                                   
;  NOTES: Simple COM infector. 10% of the time it reboots the system     
;         20% it plays machine gun noices on the PC speaker... and       
;         70% of the time is infects another COM file... Have fun...
