;LOKJAW-ZWEI: an .EXE-infecting spawning virus with retaliatory 
;anti-anti-virus capability.  For Crypt Newsletter 12, Feb. 1993.               
;
;LOKJAW-ZWEI is a resident spawning virus which installs itself in
;memory using the same engine as the original Civil War/Proto-T virus.
;It is simpler in that none of its addresses have to be 
;relative, an indirect benefit of the fact that the virus has no 
;"appending" quality.  That means, LOKJAW doesn't alter its "host" files,
;much like a number of other companion/spawning viruses published in
;previous newsletters.
;
;LOKJAW hooks interrupt 21 and infects .EXE files on execution, creating 
;itself as companion .COMfile to the "host."  Due to the inherent rules
;of DOS, this ensures the virus will be executed before the "host" the
;next time the infected program is used.  In reality, LOKJAW is even
;simpler than that.  If not in memory, the first time the host is
;called, LOKJAW will go resident and not even bother to load it.
;In most cases, the user will assume a slight error and call the host
;again, at which point it will function normally. LOKJAW will then infect
;every subsequent .EXE file called. LOKJAW is very transparent in operation,
;except when certain anti-virus programs (Integrity Master, McAfee's SCAN &
;CLEAN, F-PROT & VIRSTOP and Central Point Anti-virus) are loaded.
;LOKJAW spawning variants are so simple they don't even need much in the
;way of installation checks. The virus simply becomes resident the first
;time it is called. Once in memory, when other infect file are executed
;LOKJAW merely looks over the loaded file, if it recognizes itself it
;discards the load and proceeds to execute the "infected" file as would
;be the case on an uninfected system.
;
;LOKJAW's "stinger" code demonstrates the simplicity of creating a strongly
;retaliating virus by quickly deleting the anti-virus program before it
;can execute and then displaying a "chomping" graphic.  Even if the anti-
;virus program cannot detect LOKJAW in memory, it will be deleted.  This
;makes it essential that the user know how to either remove the virus from
;memory before beginning anti-virus measures, or at the least run the
;anti-virus component from a write-protected disk. (If the LOKJAW viruses
;are present in memory and an anti-virus program is run from a write- 
;protected disketter, it will, of course, generate "write protect" 
;errors.) At a time when retail anti-virus packages are becoming more 
;complicated - and more likely that the
;average user will run them from default installations on his hard file -
;LOKJAW's retaliating power makes it a potentially very annoying pest.
;A virus-programmer serious about inconveniencing a system could do a
;number of things with this basic idea. They are;
; 1. Remove the "chomp" effect. It is entertaining, but it exposes the virus
; instantly.
; 2. Alter the_stinger routine, so that the virus immediately attacks the
; hard file.  The implementation is demonstrated by LOKJAW-DREI, which
; merely makes the disk inaccessible until a warm reboot if an anti-virus
; program is employed against it.  By placing
; a BONA FIDE disk-trashing routine here, it becomes very hazardous for
; an unknowing user to employ anti-virus measures on a machine where
; LOKJAW or a LOKJAW-like program is memory resident. LOKJAW-DREI,
; which does not try to delete anti-virus files, displays the "chomp"
; and mimics trashing the disk even when the anti-virus program is
; used from a write-protected diskette.  Of course, the user will 
; see no "write protect" error as with the other viruses. The disk merely
; becomes inacessible.
;
;These anti-anti-virus strategies are becoming more common in viral 
;programming.                 
;
;Mark Ludwig programmed the features of a direct-action retaliating
;virus in his "Computer Virus Developments Quarterly."  Peach, Groove and
;Encroacher viruses attack anti-virus software by deletion of files central
;to the functionality of the software. 
;
;And in this issue, the Sandra virus employs a number 
;of anti-anti-virus features. 
;
;The LOKJAW source listings are TASM compatible. To remove LOKJAW-ZWEI and                
;DREI infected files from a system, simply delete the "companion" .COM 
;duplicates of your executables.  Ensure that the machine has been booted
;from a clean disk.  To remove the LOKJAW .COM-appending virus, at this
;time it will be necessary for you to restore the contaminated files from
;a clean back-up.
;
;Alert readers will notice the LOKJAW-ZWEI and DREI create their "companion"
;files in plain sight.  Generally, spawning viruses make themselves
;hidden-read-only-system files.  This is an easy hack and the code is supplied
;in earlier issues of the newsletter.  The modification is left to 
;the reader as an academic exercise.
