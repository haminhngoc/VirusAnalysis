 ;Name:        Tiny
 ;Aliases:     163 COM Virus, Tiny 163 Virus, Kennedy-163
 ;V Status:    Rare
 ;Discovery:   June, 1990
 ;Symptoms:    COMMAND.COM & .COM file growth
 ;Origin:      Denmark
 ;Eff Length:  163 Bytes
 ;Type Code:   PNCK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 ;Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, VirexPC, F-Prot 1.12+, NAV, IBM Scan 2.00+
 ;filesoval Instructions:       Scan/D, F-Prot 1.12+, or Delete infected
 ;General Comments:
       ;The 163 COM Virus, or Tiny Virus, was isolated by Fridrik Skulason
       ;of Iceland in June 1990.  This virus is a non-resident generic
       ;.COM file infector, and it will infect COMMAND.COM.

       ;The first time a file infected with the 163 COM Virus is executed,
       ;the virus will attempt to infect the first .COM file in the
       ;current directory.  On bootable diskettes, this file will normally
       ;be COMMAND.COM.  After the first .COM file is infected,each time
       ;an infected program is executed another .COM file will attempt to
       ;be infected.  Files are infected only if their original length is
       ;greater than approximately 1K bytes.

       ;Infected .COM files will increase in length by 163 bytes, and have
       ;date/time stamps in the directory changed to the date/time the
       ;infection occurred.  Infected files will also always end with this
       ;hex string: '2A2E434F4D00'.

       ;This virus currently does nothing but replicate, and is the
       ;smallest MS-DOS virus known as of its isolation date.

       ;The Tiny Virus may or may not be related to the Tiny Family.
       ;like she'd know the difference!

;OK, Theres the run down on the smallest MS-DOS virus known to man.  As for
;it being detected by SCAN we'll see about that.

;Here is a dissasembly of the virus, It can be assembled under Turbo Assembler
;or MASM.

;Its good to start off with a simple example like this. As you can see
;what the virus does is use the DOS 4Eh function to find the firsy COM file
;in the directory.  If no files are found the program exits.  If a file is
;found it compares the virus id string (the virus jump instruction) to the
;first two bytes of the COM file.  If they match the program terminates.
;If they don't match the virus will infect the file.  Using two key MS-DOS
;functions to infect.
;
;The first -
;
;INT 21h        Function 42h
;SET FILE POINTER
;
;AH   =  42h
;AL   =  method code
;BX   =  file handle
;CX   =  most significant half to offset
;DX   =  least "		       "
;
;If there is an error in executing this function the carry flag will be set,
;and AX will contian the error code.  If no error is encountered
;
;DX   =  most significant half of file pointer
;AX   =  least "			     "
;
;
;The second (and most) important function used by any virus is
;
;
;INT 21h Function 40h
;WRITE TO FILE OR DEVICE
;
;AH    =          40h
;BX    =          handle
;CX    =          number of bytes to write
;DS:DX =          segment of buffer
;
;Returns
;
;AX    =          bytes transferred
;
;on error
;
;AX    =         Error Code and flag is set.
;
;
;An example of Function 40h is ----
;
;
     ;mov     ah,40h                  ;set function
     ;mov     bx,handle               ;load bx with handle from prev open
     ;mov     cx,virus_size           ;load cx with # of bytes to write
     ;mov     dx,offset write_buffer  ;load dx with the offset of what to
				      ;write to file
     ;int     21h                     ;
;
;
;This function is used by 98% of all MS-DOS viruses to copy itself to a
;victim file.
;
;
;Now heres a sample project -  create a new strain of Tiny, have it restore
;the original date and time etc...
