// This is to be used in a program which bypasses FluShot.
// The method is completely generic and 99.99% infallible.
// To use it, #include the file and call checkflu().  This
// will set up all the necessary variables.  flu_disable()
// and flu_enable() do what they imply.
//
// NOTE:  checkflu() MUST be called before flu_disable and
//        flu_enable.
// 
// Oh yeah, it works under TC/BC
