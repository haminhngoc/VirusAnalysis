;;€€                      VIRUSES, A HIGH TECHNICAL DISEASE               €€
;;€€                                                                      €€

;;€€  The code of this virus was built into a MOVE-util. It was imple-    €€
;;€€  mented wrong. The virus went straight to the destruction code.      €€
;;€€  I've taken the code out and reconstructed it to its original        €€
;;€€  form. Because I had a listing of Ralf Burger's book I have placed   €€
;;€€  his own comments behind the code, although I've translated it into  €€
;;€€  English. The labels used, are also his.                             €€
;;€€                                                                      €€
;;€€  I've put three comments myself in the code. These can be recog-     €€
;;€€  nized by the starting ;; of it.                                     €€
;;€€                                                                      €€
;;€€  Edwin Cleton, the one who send me the MOVE util for examination     €€
;;€€  downloaded it from a BBS. So far there are no damage reports.       €€
;;€€  The move-util checked the system's date. If the date is 1 Aug       €€
;;€€  or later of any year, the virus was called.                         €€
;;€€                                                                      €€

;;€€ This sourcelisting can be recompiled with MASM 4.0+ and A86. For     €€
;;€€ compilation with A86 you must specify 'conta' and 'disks' as a word  €€
;;€€ else the definition will conflict with what A86 previously thinks.   €€

;;€€                                                                      €€
;;€€ Virus-Description:                                                   €€
;;€€ ------------------                                                   €€
;;€€                                                                      €€
;;€€ The virus infects the first COM-file in the ROOT-Directory. The      €€
;;€€ virus overwrites the first 230h bytes of the file. When an infected  €€
;;€€ file is executed it will infect one other .COM-file. The system will €€
;;€€ crash mostly afterwards because the overwritten part is not stored.  €€
;;€€ When COMMAND.COM is infected on the HDU, the system will not reboot  €€
;;€€ because COMMAND.COM is complete. Each reboot COMMAND.COM will infect €€
;;€€ one other .COM-File and the computer crashes. When all .COM-files    €€
;;€€ are infected, .EXE-files will be renamed (FCB) to .COM to become     €€
;;€€ infected. When all .COM and .EXE-files are infected, the virus will  €€
;;€€ write to sectors on disk depending on the system's time.             €€
;;€€ The infected files are lost en must be replaced by backup-copies.    €€
;;€€                                                                      €€
;;€€ The shortest size an infected file can be is 230h bytes. The code is €€
;;€€ shorter, but this is the value which has been put into the code as   €€
;;€€ the virus-length.                                                    €€
