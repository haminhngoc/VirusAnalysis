;90210 Virus from the TridenT virus research group.

;This is a semi-stealth virus that hides file-size changes while
;it is in memory.  It marks the files w/the timestamp.  It will
;infect COM files on open, execute, delete, and rename.  It checks
;if it is in memory by calling Int 21h with DEADh in AX and uses MCB's
;to go memory resident.
