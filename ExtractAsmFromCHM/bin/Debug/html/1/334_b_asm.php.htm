; Continueencrypt is implemented as a jmp-type loop. Although it's
; fine to code it this way, it's probably easier to code using the
; loop statement.  Upon close inspection, one finds the loop to be
; flawed. Note the single inc bx statement. This essentially makes
; the encryption value a a byte instead of a word, which decreases
; the number of mutations from 65,535 to 255.  Once again, this is
; just poor programming, very easily rectified with another inc bx
; statement. Another optimization could be made.  Use a
;       mov dx, [si+encryptval]
; to load up the encryption value before the loop, and replace the
; three lines following continueencrypt with a simple:
;       xor word ptr [bx], dx

; The next two lines should be executed BEFORE continueencrypt. As
; it stands right now, they are recalculated every iteration which
; slows down execution somewhat. Furthermore, the value calculated
; is much too large and this increases execution time. Yet another
