; VirusName: Fight Fire With Fire
; Country  : Sweden
; Author   : Metal Militia / Immortal Riot
; Date     : 07-22-1993
;
; This is an mutation of 7th-son from 'Unknown'.
; Many thanks to the scratch coder of 7th-son.
;
; We've tried this virus ourself, and it works just fine.
; Non-overwriting, adds 473 to any comfile over 1701 bytes,
; in current directory. No bugs have been reported.
; Originally from the Netherlands, in 1991.
;
; This is the second real mutation of 7th-son.
;
; McAfee Scan v105 can't find it, and
; S&S Toolkit 6.5 don't find it either.
;
; I haven't tried with scanners like Fprot/Tbscan,
; but they will probably report some virus structure.
;
; Best Regards : [Metal Militia]
