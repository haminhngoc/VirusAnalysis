Article Title: 382 Virus
Author: Admiral Bailey

;
; 382 Virus (Family-Q as McAfee 91 calls it)
;
; Disassembled By Admiral Bailey [YAM '92]
; June 25, 1992
;
; The writer of this is unknown to me... maybe you should put some of
; your info in it.
;
; Notes:This virus I found on a board and got right to it.  It wasnt
;       too hard to disassemble since there was no encryption.  Its an
;       .com over writing virus.  Yes there is ????????exe inside the
;       file but I don't know what the hell that is.  If you run it it
;       only overwrits the com files.  It probably get exe files if no
;       com files are found.  But anyways there seems to be a bug in
;       the original virus.  Put it in a directory and run it it will
;       display crap and crash the computer.  With out doing any
;       damage.  If you want any more info check it out for yourself.
;       All i did this time was comment it.. cuz i found this to be a
;       boring run of the mill virus.  Anyways here it is.
