; VirusName: The thing that should not be
; Country  : Sweden
; Author   : Metal Militia / Immortal Riot
; Date     : 07-29-1993
;
; This is a mutation of the Bad Brains by skism, USA
; It was found in April 1992. Many thanx goes to the
; scratch coder of it!
;
; This is a non-resident direct action infector of com files,
; including command.com. It infects one .COM file on the current 
; drive, each time it's run by overwrite it. If the file is smaller
; than the virus, it will grow to that size.
;
; This will work just fine, and
; Scan v105 can't find it, neither can 
; S&S Toolkit 6.5.
;
; Havn't tried with F-PROT and TBSCAN, but they  will probably
; report some virus structure in the file.
