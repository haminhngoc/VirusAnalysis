TITLE  PINGB-C.ASM - Ping Pong "B" virus assembly source code (CLEAN VERSION)

COMMENT #     Read the following carefully:

              THIS FILE IS INTENDED FOR EXAMINATION ONLY.

WARNING: DO *NOT* RUN THE RESULTING COM OR EXE FILE!!!!!!!!!
This virus, when assembled, is (almost) harmless if left in a file.
At best, the code will overwrite part of DOS and hang your machine.
At worst, it could wipe out the Boot record of A: or the master boot
record of your hard disk.  Since the virus MUST be loaded from a boot
sector to function properly, running the code from DOS will definitely
cause problems.

DISCLAIMER: The author will NOT be held responsible for any damages
            caused by careless use of the information presented here.

NOTE: This is the "clean" copy of the Ping Pong B virus.  It "corrects"
      the coding quirks listed below.


THEORY OF OPERATION:

1) A disk with the virus is booted.
2) The BIOS memory count is decreased by 2k, to prevent DOS from
   overwriting the virus, and relocates itself to the reserved space.
3) Part II of the virus is read into RAM just after part I.
4) The original boot sector is read to 0000:7C00.
5) Virus gets and saves the address of INT 13h, the BIOS disk service
   interrupt routine, then hooks its own routine in place.
6) The virus jumps to 0000:7C00, load DOS if possible.


INFECTION PROCESS:

1) A BIOS read request is preformed on the target disk.
2) If the drive is different from the last drive that was read from, then
   attempt infection immediately.  Otherwise, check the BIOS clock tick
   count to see if it's time to activate the bouncing ball routine.
3) Read very first sector of the disk.  If it's a hard disk, then search
   for a DOS-12 or DOS-16 partition, and if found, read the first sector
   of THAT partition.  We now have the "normal" boot record of the target
   disk in the sector buffer.
4) Copy the BPB from the boot record to the virus code space.
5) Check virus' signature in the boot record to see if infected before.
   Check disk structure; virus needs 512 byte sectors, and at least 2 sectors
   per cluster to infect the disk.
6) Calculate number of system use sectors, data sectors, and maximum cluster
   number.
7) Starting with the first sector of the FAT, search for a free cluster.
   If none found, then don't infect the disk.
8) The first free cluster is flagged as bad, and the FAT is updated.  Note
   that only the first copy of the FAT will be modified.
9) The original boot sector is re-read and written to the second sector of
   the virus' cluster.  Part II of the virus is written to the first sector.
   Part I is written to sector 0, replacing the original boot record.


INFECTION RESTRICTIONS:

0) The virus cannot infect a write-protected disk (obvious, isn't it?)
1) The virus will not infect a non-DOS bootable hard disk.
2) The virus will only infect a disk with 512 byte sectors, and at least two
   sectors per cluster.  This rules out 1.44M and 1.2M disks, among others.
3) The virus will not infect a disk with no free space (from DOS's view).


CODING QUIRKS: (All have been corrected!!)

1) The virus uses a "MOV CS,AX" instruction to continue execution after
   relocating itself to higher memory (see MEMORY MAP, below).  This should
   not work on a 286 or 386 system (the author has not tried it!).
2) The virus uses several "MOV rr,0" instructions (where rr is a 16-bit
   register).  It could be replaced by "XOR rr,0" to save a byte.
3) The virus uses "XOR rr,0FFH" and "INC rr" to negate a value (by first
   computing the ones complement, then adding one to get the twos
   complement.)  This could be replaced by "NEG rr" to save three bytes.
4) The use of OFS_ADJ (see below for computation) is needed to let me use
   an ORG of 0 when assembling the file.  I could've used ORG 07C00h, but
   that would create a file about 32k in size on assembling.  Instead, I
   chose to add this offset manually to force correct address generation.


MEMORY MAP:    (Adjusted for "clean" version!!)

The virus will relocate itself 2k below the top of memory.  The virus
itself is 1024 bytes, and uses a 512 byte buffer when infecting other
disks.  In all, the virus uses 1.5k of memory that is 512 bytes below
the BIOS top of memory count.  For a 640k machine the map becomes:

        640.0k (9F80:0800, which is A000:0000) ==> Top of memory
	639.5k (9F80:0600 to 9F80:07FF) ==> Unused
        639.0k (9F80:0400 to 9F80:05FF) ==> Buffer used by virus
        638.5k (9F80:0200 to 9F80:03FF) ==> 2nd part of virus code
        638.0k (9F80:0000 to 9F80:01FF) ==> Main part of Ping Pong virus

TITLE  PINGB-C.ASM - Ping Pong "B" virus assembly source code (CLEAN VERSION)

COMMENT #     Read the following carefully:

              THIS FILE IS INTENDED FOR EXAMINATION ONLY.

WARNING: DO *NOT* RUN THE RESULTING COM OR EXE FILE!!!!!!!!!
This virus, when assembled, is (almost) harmless if left in a file.
At best, the code will overwrite part of DOS and hang your machine.
At worst, it could wipe out the Boot record of A: or the master boot
record of your hard disk.  Since the virus MUST be loaded from a boot
sector to function properly, running the code from DOS will definitely
cause problems.

DISCLAIMER: The author will NOT be held responsible for any damages
            caused by careless use of the information presented here.

NOTE: This is the "clean" copy of the Ping Pong B virus.  It "corrects"
      the coding quirks listed below.


THEORY OF OPERATION:

1) A disk with the virus is booted.
2) The BIOS memory count is decreased by 2k, to prevent DOS from
   overwriting the virus, and relocates itself to the reserved space.
3) Part II of the virus is read into RAM just after part I.
4) The original boot sector is read to 0000:7C00.
5) Virus gets and saves the address of INT 13h, the BIOS disk service
   interrupt routine, then hooks its own routine in place.
6) The virus jumps to 0000:7C00, load DOS if possible.


INFECTION PROCESS:

1) A BIOS read request is preformed on the target disk.
2) If the drive is different from the last drive that was read from, then
   attempt infection immediately.  Otherwise, check the BIOS clock tick
   count to see if it's time to activate the bouncing ball routine.
3) Read very first sector of the disk.  If it's a hard disk, then search
   for a DOS-12 or DOS-16 partition, and if found, read the first sector
   of THAT partition.  We now have the "normal" boot record of the target
   disk in the sector buffer.
4) Copy the BPB from the boot record to the virus code space.
5) Check virus' signature in the boot record to see if infected before.
   Check disk structure; virus needs 512 byte sectors, and at least 2 sectors
   per cluster to infect the disk.
6) Calculate number of system use sectors, data sectors, and maximum cluster
   number.
7) Starting with the first sector of the FAT, search for a free cluster.
   If none found, then don't infect the disk.
8) The first free cluster is flagged as bad, and the FAT is updated.  Note
   that only the first copy of the FAT will be modified.
9) The original boot sector is re-read and written to the second sector of
   the virus' cluster.  Part II of the virus is written to the first sector.
   Part I is written to sector 0, replacing the original boot record.


INFECTION RESTRICTIONS:

0) The virus cannot infect a write-protected disk (obvious, isn't it?)
1) The virus will not infect a non-DOS bootable hard disk.
2) The virus will only infect a disk with 512 byte sectors, and at least two
   sectors per cluster.  This rules out 1.44M and 1.2M disks, among others.
3) The virus will not infect a disk with no free space (from DOS's view).


CODING QUIRKS: (All have been corrected!!)

1) The virus uses a "MOV CS,AX" instruction to continue execution after
   relocating itself to higher memory (see MEMORY MAP, below).  This should
   not work on a 286 or 386 system (the author has not tried it!).
2) The virus uses several "MOV rr,0" instructions (where rr is a 16-bit
   register).  It could be replaced by "XOR rr,0" to save a byte.
3) The virus uses "XOR rr,0FFH" and "INC rr" to negate a value (by first
   computing the ones complement, then adding one to get the twos
   complement.)  This could be replaced by "NEG rr" to save three bytes.
4) The use of OFS_ADJ (see below for computation) is needed to let me use
   an ORG of 0 when assembling the file.  I could've used ORG 07C00h, but
   that would create a file about 32k in size on assembling.  Instead, I
   chose to add this offset manually to force correct address generation.


MEMORY MAP:    (Adjusted for "clean" version!!)

The virus will relocate itself 2k below the top of memory.  The virus
itself is 1024 bytes, and uses a 512 byte buffer when infecting other
disks.  In all, the virus uses 1.5k of memory that is 512 bytes below
the BIOS top of memory count.  For a 640k machine the map becomes:

        640.0k (9F80:0800, which is A000:0000) ==> Top of memory
	639.5k (9F80:0600 to 9F80:07FF) ==> Unused
        639.0k (9F80:0400 to 9F80:05FF) ==> Buffer used by virus
        638.5k (9F80:0200 to 9F80:03FF) ==> 2nd part of virus code
        638.0k (9F80:0000 to 9F80:01FF) ==> Main part of Ping Pong virus
