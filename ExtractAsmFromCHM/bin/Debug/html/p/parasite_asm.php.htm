;
;         *** NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION ***     The Vienna Virus
;
; This file is for the purpose of virus study only! It should not be passed
;  around among the general public. It will be very useful for learning
;  how viruses work and propagate. But anybody with access to an assembler
;  can turn it into a working virus and anybody with a bit of assembly coding
;  experience can turn it into a far more malevolent program than it already
;  is. Keep this code in responsible hands!
;
; This program does not check wether or not the .COM file to be infected is
;  really a .COM file or simply a misnamed .EXE file. DOS does not rely on the
;  file extension, but does a double-check by looking for a signature that
;  indicates wether or not a file REALLY is an .EXE file. The virus writer 
;  apparently did not know this. This virus will take any .EXE file that's 
;  been renamed to a .COM file and try to infect it, obscuring the signature 
;  that marks it as an .EXE file. When the infected file is then run, the
;  virus code will run first, and then the machine will try to run the .EXE
;  header data as though it were code. This is likely to crash the machine, and
;  since some later versions of DOS itself contain such misnamed .EXE files,
;  it's likely to happen.
;
;******************************************************************************

;******************************************************************************
;It seems that MASM won't always willingly translate ordinary assembly code
; into the byte-for-byte replacement of the code in the Vienna Virus. Since
; MASM is just a 2 pass assembler, it doesn't always have enough information to
; figure out the size of an instruction when it needs to. To be safe, it makes
; its guess on the high side and then adds in unrequested NOPS if it needs to
; pad out the space it allocated. Many of the NOPs in this virus are the result
; of this. But the virus writer seems to have done a bit of hand modification
; to the virus, and as a result, one instance where we'd expect a NOP, there
; isn't one. This macro allows us to mimic that instance, where an ordinary
; MOV CX,xx would otherwise have worked fine.

;
;         *** NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION ***     The Vienna Virus
;
; This file is for the purpose of virus study only! It should not be passed
;  around among the general public. It will be very useful for learning
;  how viruses work and propagate. But anybody with access to an assembler
;  can turn it into a working virus and anybody with a bit of assembly coding
;  experience can turn it into a far more malevolent program than it already
;  is. Keep this code in responsible hands!
;
; This program does not check wether or not the .COM file to be infected is
;  really a .COM file or simply a misnamed .EXE file. DOS does not rely on the
;  file extension, but does a double-check by looking for a signature that
;  indicates wether or not a file REALLY is an .EXE file. The virus writer 
;  apparently did not know this. This virus will take any .EXE file that's 
;  been renamed to a .COM file and try to infect it, obscuring the signature 
;  that marks it as an .EXE file. When the infected file is then run, the
;  virus code will run first, and then the machine will try to run the .EXE
;  header data as though it were code. This is likely to crash the machine, and
;  since some later versions of DOS itself contain such misnamed .EXE files,
;  it's likely to happen.
;
;******************************************************************************

;******************************************************************************
;It seems that MASM won't always willingly translate ordinary assembly code
; into the byte-for-byte replacement of the code in the Vienna Virus. Since
; MASM is just a 2 pass assembler, it doesn't always have enough information to
; figure out the size of an instruction when it needs to. To be safe, it makes
; its guess on the high side and then adds in unrequested NOPS if it needs to
; pad out the space it allocated. Many of the NOPs in this virus are the result
; of this. But the virus writer seems to have done a bit of hand modification
; to the virus, and as a result, one instance where we'd expect a NOP, there
; isn't one. This macro allows us to mimic that instance, where an ordinary
; MOV CX,xx would otherwise have worked fine.
